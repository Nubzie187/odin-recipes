    <h3>Country Ham and Biscuits</h3>
    <p>We admit it—we love the way that butter or some sort of grease makes food taste, especially bacon grease. 
        That's why we use it to cook up country ham. I use it more than Rachel, so I have people save their 
        bacon grease for me. I tell them, "Don't throw away your bacon grease!" And when somebody says, 
        "How do you keep your skin looking so good?" I tell them, "Bacon grease...from the inside out!" 
        — Dolly Parton</p>

    <h3>Step by Step</h3>    
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). Grease an 8-inch cast-iron skillet with shortening.</li>
            <li>In a large mixing bowl or food processor, sift together flour, sugar, baking powder, salt, and cream of tartar. Mix to combine.</li>
            <li>Cut butter and 1/4 cup shortening into the flour mixture until crumbly. Add buttermilk and gently stir until just combined.</li>
            <li>Turn out dough onto a floured surface. Pat to 2-inch thickness, cut out biscuits, and transfer to skillet. Bake for about 30 minutes.</li>
            <li>While baking, cook ham in a skillet with bacon grease until browned. Drain on a paper towel-lined plate.</li>
            <li>To serve, split biscuits, spread with butter, and add ham slices.</li>
        </ol>
